        <h2>Welcome to Java ReStart with WebFX!</h2>
        <!--It is a demo site of a concept of a new web called WebFX.<br/>-->
        <!--You may ask, what's wrong with old Web?<br/>-->
        <!--IMHO, the main problem with old Web is JavaScript.-->
        <!--JavaScript is ineffective, it's hard to write complex programs in JavaScript-->
        <!--and other languages that are translated to JavaScript have issues.-->
        <!--And if we look at modern browsers we can notice that they are not HTML renderers anymore.-->
        <!--They are more JavaScript VM engines today.<br/>-->
        <!--However there is a better VM that is called Java VM.-->
        <!--So the main idea of WebFX project is to replace JavaScript VM with Java VM in the Web.<p/>-->
        The site presents two open source projects:
        <a href="https://github.com/brunoborges/webfx">WebFX</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/pjBooms/Java-ReStart">Java ReStart</a>.<p/>

        To run the samples below you will need <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/">Java 8</a> and
        a small <a href="https://github.com/pjBooms/Java-ReStart/releases/download/v0.1.1-alpha/JavaRestart.jar"> executable jar</a> that you may run as:<p/>
        <code>java -jar JavaRestart.jar</code><p/>
        It will run WebFX browser (located remotely) from which you can run the samples below.
        (The samples will not run in a traditional browser.)<p/>

        <h3>WebFX samples</h3>
        <p/>
        <a href="WebFXDemo/WebFXDemo.fxml">WebFX Demo</a> - collection of WebFX samples<br/>
        <a href="JavaRestartDemo/JavaRestartDemo.fxml">Java ReStart Demo</a> - collection of Java ReStart demos<br/>
        <a href="helloworld/helloworld.fxml">Hello World</a> - the simplest FXML/JavaScript page<br/>
        <a href="hellogroovy/hellogroovy.fxml">Hello Groovy</a> - the simplest FXML/Groovy page<br/>
        <a href="login/login.fxml">Login</a> - tip: login as "metronome" to come into the demo below<br/>
        <a href="metronome/metronome.fxml">Metronome</a> - the simplest JavaFX animation demo<br/>
        <a href="media/media.fxml">Media</a> - the simplest JavaFX video player demo<br/>

        <h3>What is WebFX and Java ReStart</h3>
        WebFX is an attempt to create a new web where HTML is replaced with FXML - the markup language for
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javafx-overview-2158620.html">JavaFX</a> UI,
        and the logic can be written in any programming language that is available on top of Java platform
        from JavaScript, Groovy, JRuby to Java, Kotlin and Scala.
        Java ReStart is a complimentary project that acts as transport layer for WebFX allowing FXML pages
        to reference arbitrary Java byte code on a web server and hence any custom JavaFX UI components
        and Java third-party libraries. In addition, Java ReStart allows to run arbitrary Java applications
        instantly from a web server downloading only required parts of applications on demand and executing
        them in parallel with downloading.

        <h3> Some more details</h3>

        Any scripting language that is available on of Java platform such as JavaScript, Groovy, JRuby
        can be used for writing UI logic in WebFX technology - the languages can be embedded transparently into FXML.
        This way you may employ rapid style development that developers used to use in the traditional web.
        For instance, <a href="helloworld/helloworld.fxml">Hello World</a> sample below uses simple
        <a href="https://github.com/brunoborges/webfx/blob/master/webfx-samples/src/main/webapp/helloworld/helloworld.js"> JavaScript</a> code,
        while <a href="hellogroovy/hellogroovy.fxml">Hello Groovy</a> sample uses simple
        <a href="https://github.com/brunoborges/webfx/blob/master/webfx-samples/src/main/webapp/hellogroovy/hellogroovy.groovy">Groovy</a> script code.<p/>

        Moreover, your FXML files may reference arbitrary Java byte code on a web server and hence any custom JavaFX UI components and Java third-party libraries
        via <a href="https://github.com/pjBooms/Java-ReStart">Java ReStart</a> technology.
        So this way, you may write your client-side logic on any language that is available on top of Java platform such as Scala, Kotlin, whatever.
        For instance,
        <a href="wfx://javarestart.com/apps/RestDemo">REST demo</a> can play music from remote server
        and the communication with the server is written in pure Java, while
        <a href="https://github.com/pjBooms/Java-ReStart/blob/master/apps/RestDemo/controller.js">UI</a>
        is handled by JavaScript.
        You may also check <a href="wfx://javarestart.com/apps/Game2048">2048</a> game that is pure
        <a href="https://github.com/brunoborges/fx2048/tree/master/src/game2048">Java</a> code.
        In addition, Java ReStart allows to run arbitrary Java applications instantly from a web server downloading
        only required parts of applications on demand and executing them in parallel with downloading.
        This way applications run instantly like in the Web.
        For instance, you may run <a href="java://javarestart.com/apps/Game2048">2048 game</a>
        not in a browser tab but as separate application.<p/>

        <h3> Video links </h3>

        This project is developed mainly on hackathons <a href="http://www.excelsior-usa.com/blog/news/hack-day-i/#more-1906">like this</a>.<br/>
        And I have some pitch videos (3 minutes in length) from the hackathons.
        So if you do no want to run the samples above (or they do not work for you for some reason)
        you may just watch the videos below demonstrating the projects:
        <p/>

        <h3>Your help is welcome!</h3>
        I understand that this page looks ugly, especially for a technology pretending to be the new Web.<br/>
        But I am a <a href="http://excelsiorjet.com">JVM</a> engineer, not a web developer.
        However the page is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/pjBooms/Java-ReStart/blob/master/server/src/main/webapp/index.html">github</a>.
        So if you can help to beautify it, please provide a pool request.<br/>
        And if you are a JavaFX technology fan and have some beauty examples that you would like
        to be available for instant running from WebFX browser via this site, please also either
        provide a pool request or <a href="mailto:nikita.v.lipsky@gmail.com">contact me</a>.
        Contriubutions to the projects are also welcome.
        You may also contact me with any other feedback or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/pjBooms">Twitter</a>.
        <p/>
        Tnank you for your attention!
